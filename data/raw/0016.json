                    "cons": "1. Poor competency of Mid-seniour management. I was shocked to know that my manager didn't have any coding experience. How dare a company hire me and put me under a guy who is not competant enough?  I was surprised to know that he doesn't even know to write hello world program. \r\n2. Most of the managers have just shifted from Infosys just for the sake of saving themselves being revealed at Infosys. \r\n3. No competency check for manager level. They just comes to office to plan their next onsite travel.\r\n4. In one instance a manager bought Samsung Galaxy Edge from team's fund but has been using it for personal use.\r\n5. God knows why they call it a product company? It's still a service company who licks the customer's boot.\r\n6. All promotion and hike is just a dream for you, if you are honest to your work and company. If you need a good hike, promotion and onsite opportunity so can better think of polishing your manager's shoe. \r\n7. I have seen manager's leaking paper so that their followers could join edgeverve. \r\n8. Some hiring is just useless and without thought. Less of technical guys and more of management,  an inverted pyramid structure just like poor service companies. \r\n9. Everyone is looting the company's fund at their level. Few of the managers just go to France to have a cup of coffee. \r\n10. No exposure and poor career opportunity if you are willing to start your career here. \r\n\r\n11. Junior level technical guys are given no opportunities to what's around. No funding for seminars and other stuffs.  Once I have approached my manager for sponsorship of a developer summit that was supposed to be held at bangalore,  but I got a response that there is no fund. But the very next week they got funds to go to US just to attend a road show. Guys atleast have some shame. You should promote knowledge base of junior level guys. Rather than filling your pockets with company's fund.",
