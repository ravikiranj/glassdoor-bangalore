He starts by making you feel that you could be of value and then finds a way to sack you before you turn a permanent employee or get selected by the Corporate body. There is no system to look after employees and managers kill you with work and then put ridiculous amounts of pressure on you and make you wonder why there are no hires as compared to another individual in the same week and constantly have fights over calls with the management. No where in the two years that I worked with them did they help me when I needed training or when I needed support from my parent company against tasks that were not being complete in time. \r\n\r\nThey spend nothing on training you and make your life a living hell when they request you to work from home and on Saturdays. Even schedulers are asked to recruit in this company and they keep moving you from one client office to the next on the sacking of an employee. They falsify information when they want you out and there is a lot of news where they make cases against employees that \"break their contract\" if they decide to move on within a year. Its the worst experience one could ever go through and what's worse when you work for MNCs, they expect that you get some training and then their five managers and Acculogix's three managers and team leaders will breathe down your necks. Two of my friends have even had nervous break downs and one had to undergo an operation and when she came back there was another person who was hired in the month that she was not in her seat. Yes they fire people.",
