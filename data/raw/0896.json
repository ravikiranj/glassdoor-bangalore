This directly triggers one's  sense of belonging to the firm as opposed to feeling like you're 'working for' someone. \r\n\r\n- All 3 of them are very humble, jovial and approachable people and yet have an extremely passionate aura about them which is contagious.  \r\n\r\n- The growth in the firm both in skill and financially has been fantastic and i truly believe is only going to get better. \r\n\r\nAll in all, working in Trebound with this wonderful team feels like finding a new family outside home. Mondays have taken the top slot in being the best day of the week and i'm quite certain that with this team, there is no stopping us!",
