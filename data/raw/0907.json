                    "cons": "Very bad working environment at playgroundonline\r\n\r\nHi I was working 4 playgroundonline for 1 yr and few months. \r\n\r\nIf you decided to join in this company please read the following review and then re-consider your decision.  I left this company for the following reasons ---\r\n\r\nNo proper work assignment from management,\r\nNo Followups.  and then giving work pressure on the same. (without any reason)\r\nYou should work apart from your study skills and experience. Sometime you should also do packaging for customer orders. \r\nNone of the online system is not automated. Everything is manual operation. In clear you must be there if any customer is ordering on Saturday. And if you are a customer care rep you must lie to them.  \r\nYou may feel you are working for old school company. Still that old design website (slow website) very slow admin system. \r\n\r\nPopular word from management:  We are a start-up company selling sports goods\u2026 (This company founded in 2008 before flipkart  and still saying staying it to new people)\r\n\r\nOffice type:  you should work at vegetable market like office space with mosquito and road site pollution. \r\nAnyone speaks from the corner it will distract you sitting on the other corner. \r\n\r\nOffice communication medium:  Telugu and Hindi (Less English) \r\n\r\nManagement quote for all the time-- \"we want sales sales sales sales sales and we will not encourage any of you.\"\r\n(if you are working hard and delivering good work you will not get encouragement from them.)\r\n\r\nManagement of two man army wants only sales not growth for this company. \r\n\r\nWeekly 6 days office. \r\n\r\nNo sick leave, no causal leave and  there no word called leave in this office.  If you take that it is LOP (Loss of pay) for you. \r\n\r\nthey did not paid my last month salary. and they will not pay yours also. \r\n\r\nThis is part 1. Later I will share more.",
