They are offering less salary as compared to others, and the worst part is, the salary is never given on time. Salary will be given once in 3-4 months only.\r\n3. You have to ask for salary every day, and they keep on promising, whatever the amount is for salary, it will be deducted for some unnecessary reasons.\r\n4.
