Its a small company and here are the major issues with them\r\n\r\n(1) Very unprofessional people, even don't know how to talk. Hrs specially,behaves terrible. They will start shouting if you ask something. No response to mails unless you make a complaint to higher management.\r\n\r\n(2) Recruiters will beg you to join them,  they will try  to convince you as much as she can do . She will treat you like you are her best friend and will try to butter you in many ways. I found it very unprofessional. \r\n\r\n(3) Even though they pay good(If you can negotiate), hike is worst. You have to fight with them after that they will agree.\r\n\r\n(4) NO JOB SECURITY. All the time you will be working as contractor. They are not gonna inform you when project is going to finish in advance and will make story. Best part is you will not get salary if you are unbilled, they will keep you under their employment but without pay.  \r\nThey will say they have a lot of clients like TechM, wipro but trust me they don't have. They don't have their own office. Either working on client location or not working at all.\r\n\r\n(5) Only in hand salary is good but no other benefits like good insurance.",
