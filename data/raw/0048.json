People who have stayed and believe in vision of company are handsomely rewarded, not only in monetary terms but also the responsibilities they own. \r\n\r\nThe work culture promotes entrepreneurship and individual growth. The company works as a team and one being in to any function get to interact with other teams to solve problems.\r\n\r\nLot of flexibility offered in work hours and organisation cares about its employees and always extends the help needed. \r\n\r\nCofounders always guide the teams and lead from the front.
