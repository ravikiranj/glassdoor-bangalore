In fact, it's so great that in the past few years, I noticed that the majority of my co-workers now come all the way from some remote rural villages on the other side of the planet to work here.  That is the power and influence of a great company has on a global level.  If you naysayers keep posting negative reviews, just keep in mind that there are hundreds and thousands of highly educated, loyal employees eager to help you out with your next mortgage payment.",

In fact, they are so popular, there won't be any left if you are not quick and sit close to the kitchen. \r\n\r\n- STRESS-FREE: You never have to worry about job security or discipline because management has created a world class culture of a start-up. It's so refreshing that we are rated #1 by newskarnataka.\r\n\r\n- MANAGERIAL SUPPORT: Management is so focused on employee well-being and workload that they will help you without even being asked. When it comes to helping you with your work or your personal life, no support is too little, they care that much about all of us!\r\n\r\n- EQUAL TREATMENT: There's absolutely no favoritism! Everyone--regardless of race, gender, age, sexual orientation, pay grade, parking skill or religion--is taken care of exactly the same. It doesn't matter if you're an employee, foreign contractor, you know you'll always be treated the same if you park at the visitors' spots for too long.\r\n\r\n- EXCITING DYNAMIC ENVIRONMENT: with the best product road-map, corporate vision and competent leadership, each day is a thrilling barrage of customer praises, technical challenge and great teamwork. Each day and night. you'll feel an overwhelming sense of accomplishment and can't help hugging the person sitting next to you at the end of the day.\r\n\r\n- FLAT ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE: there is virtually no bureaucracy. Everyone is on the same level, in the building or out in the parking lot. It doesn't matter where you are in the organization--a senior director or the janitor--executive management will treat your opinions with great care and execution. Everyone has a voice at this great company, and the feedback has been phenomenal.\r\n\r\n- OWN YOUR CAREER: there is great HR leadership and organizational strategy which means the opportunities for you are endless!  We are growing at exponential rate and soon there will be lots of new faces to join us.\r\n\r\nSort the reviews by \"ratings\" to see what Tillster is really like. There is great leadership, strategy and vision. Bad reviews are short-sighted and counter productive.  Executives sign advantageous contracts with customers to win business, then help operations and engineering teams to deliver on those good agreements and timelines. The executive team will not sacrifice sustainability, scalability, employees. Integrity is in the DNA of the company.\r\n\r\nThere are no divisions across the company between the different U.S. locations (LA, San Diego and Atlanta) and across teams supporting various customers. Executives will not throw ANYONE under the bus, and helping each other (as long as they're around or on the conference call). In my years working with this competent management I have only heard a senior executive apologize for a poor decision once. Once! That's how flawless we have become, and that one time screw-up was probably caused by some PM that we shall not name. \r\n\r\nFor the competent, hardworking employees, Tillster was a non-stop cycle of great promises, hope and motivating interactions with our executive leadership. There are countless senior executives that actually make/are trying to make Tillster a better place. Across the board, the entire C-level team is great, especially the CEO, CMO, CHRO, CTO and CFO. Our organization is run by our CEO who has great experience.\r\n\r\nDuring my time at Tillster at least four major brands signed up because they were fed up with our competitors and felt her integrity will help them to turn the business around. That is true leadership and it motivates us to do a good work.",

Earlier the GET's and ET's were valued assets, but now they are just tools to be used and thrown away. They used to invest a lot to make sure that new trainees learn a lot. Now they are used to do menial jobs and replace them with the new batch. Every year 20-35 trainees of a batch of 40-50 resign.
