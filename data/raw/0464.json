He was nothing like what my collage mentor told us about CEO's and top management people attitude. He was calm and composed. Initially he was not ready to take us on because of the reason that it was a start up. But, we were able to convince him that we will watch and learn. We all visited the company and Mr. Irfan made us feel  so comfortable that i did not want to leave the place. It was fun and at the same time we finished out internship and our project got approved. Finally on the last day Irfan sir asked me if I would like to continue there as an employee. I was thrilled and agreed at once. Imagine fresh out of collage and job already! It was a shame that after 2 years i went on to join another company, FAMILY pressure you know. What ever i am now, i give full credit to Mr. Irfan Qazi, Lubna mam and e-centric consultancy.",
