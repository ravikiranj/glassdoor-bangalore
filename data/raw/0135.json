People help each other and truly work as a team. Great level of trust, dedication, technical knowledge  and maturity from a  young team.\n\n2. Zero Politics and Open door culture: From CXOs to Entry level employees , everyone is always approachable to discuss tech , guide and party too :P.  There is no hierarchial politics.\n\n3. Cutting Edge Technology : The Technology at Zapr is one of it's kind in the country. From latest tech in Big Data, Digital signal processing to latest deployment techniques, Zapr tries to be as technologically updated as possible. A lot of emphasis is laid on code quality which is rare in early stage startups. For software engineers, it's an ocean of opportunities. There is so much scope to learn , develop and own things and that too on something really unique. It is rare to find this kind of software development work for someone in  early stages of his/her career. Along with normal development work, engineers here are inspired  to explore open source, attend  conferences , discuss tech among themselves and learn new tech. \n\n4. Founders : They have to be one of the coolest founders around. Very Dedicated, technologically skilled and focused along with being fun loving and super cool. Employees' opinions matter to them and are taken into consideration.\n\n5. Co-workers : It's the employees who make a company a great place to work and Zapr is a perfect example. People here work hard not because they have to but because they want to. From VPs to interns , employees have a very strong sense of ownership in what they do. \n\n6. Perks and Aminities : Stocked up pantry with snacks , fruits and juice - whatever you would like :) Free booze every Friday :P \n\n7. Flexible timings \n\n8. You get what you are promised : Generally , while hiring , companies try to project everything extravagantly and a lot of times those things don't turn out to be as promised. Zapr tries to be very straightforward and focused on what they want right from the start of the hiring  process. The clarity of role & responsibilities and cultural fit  for potential hires is very seriously considered.\n\nFrom Engineering to the work environment, Zapr media labs is an ideal place to work. In the startup burst of this age in our country, Zapr stands out in many perspectives. Here is a company which is developing something very different and trying to make a mark on the world , not just India. Currently Zapr is expanding in the Middle East and South East Asia. Can you imagine that something so unique which is backed by big media giants like 21st Century fox , Hotstar etc is being developed in a small space in Indiranagar , Bengaluru ? :)",
