But my  employer did not charged me a single penny for this. \r\n\r\nGot one month surprising Bonus on Jan 2016, which really helped me. Never I could expect these kind of perks in the so called IT gaints TCS, infy, wipro.\r\n\r\nReady to discuss leave plans openly, which in found very difficult in my previous company.\r\n\r\nGot my B1 visa last month and may travel for two months for client meetings. All sponsored by Drishticon.\r\n\r\nYour refunds will be processed in a day or tow.",
