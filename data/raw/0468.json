No fun activities and much scope to interact with other teams in the company. No proper induction or hand-holding. HR should be more proactive and should ensure employees are involved. Further, too much cost-cutting makes it difficult to appreciate the system as such. No clarity on employee's career growth. No efforts for employee retention.",

They give value to employees who are proactive, smart, think out of box, and are vocal about their thoughts. They give time for you to learn on your own (at least I was given)...I have had tough times, but now that I have left the company and have seen worse workplaces, this one definitely is a better one. A great place if you love independence at work, want ownership and Flexible work timings, managers are good, helpful and let you use your brain and take ownership of work. CEO is, at times difficult, a bit hyper person, but usually a noble man. He is open to accept his mistakes and rectify it at the earliest (the best thing in a man... (If he feels it was unjust for you, he ensures to correct it asap). A friendly environment. Everyone is considerate about you if you are in trouble - both professionally and personally. People don't show much of attitude. The best thing- there is work-life balance when compared to other start ups and SMEs. The young crowd is ready to help each other. A place to share knowledge with peers.",
