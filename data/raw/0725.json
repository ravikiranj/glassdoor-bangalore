You will end up making lakhs for the company along with a few peanuts for yourself and weekly alcohol to boost your morale and enslavement. For example SAY YOU EARN THE COMPANY $78000 USD you will probably take 10000 rupees home from all that you make. YES THAT'S how MUCH PROFIT THEY MAKE 99% FOR COMPANY AND 1% FOR YOU IF U ACHIEVE THERE DEMANDS If you believe your a genuine hard worker there are better opportunities. In lay man's terms don't become the golden goose.  I have worked for 10months - the company is a year and a half old .. So I know what I'm saying.",
