My uncle in house-keeping at Prosim helped me get training.\r\ninitially very tough i felt, they stressed on basics. after 6 months they gave me offer letter, i worked on-site 6 months at a European company in Pune - FEA. it gave me oppurtunity to see different parts of India. \r\none day i got a call from my manager telling i have to shift to bangalore due to good performance.\r\n\r\ni got promotion after pune. i purchased my parents gifts and one car on loan. now after 2.5 years i manage 3 people under me.\r\n\r\nno other company would allow such less experienced employee to become manager. but prosim believed in my capabilities.\r\n\r\nmy parents never thought this would happen with me. Work culture is very good. peoples here are very helpful. employees never feel any out of the home atmosphere. company understood our dificulty. Everyday 7pm dinner is arranged so we don't go home hungry.",
