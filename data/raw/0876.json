But the micromanagement by her as well as changing things according to her mood has a negative impact on the employees. infact even the most capable managers looks like they are figure heads since they don't really have a say. Everyone works whole day and then in the evening (morning in new york) is when we get a feedback or any update and most of it has to be ASAP and hence people end up staying late almost everyday. Since it is a small team and everyone is accountable, few end up working from home too. \r\nmost people there worked really hard and didn't mind staying late too. but over time, it makes you doubt yourself and whether is it worth it.\r\n\r\nEven though it looks like an independent startup from the outside, It is in-fact owned by the prestige group and all the HR and tech related issues need to go through them. Even though the team is really good and works well, any problem needs to go through the prestige and sometimes things take days to solve.",
