While the teams and company does achieve all the unrealistic targets; almost every single time, company doesn't float on liquid or reserve funds and is always directly dependent on regular collections. Delay in collection = delay in salaries/payments. No project for a month = No billing = No funds. So hiring is always on, 24/7/365. Even before the guys settle down, they start looking out and move.\r\n\r\n2. The founder is untouched with family responsibilities. The work-life balance is a myth in this company. You might end up sitting in meetings till 1-2-3 AM every single day, like in war room  situation, without any commendable result.\r\n\r\n3. There are times when this strategy floats on emotions (of CEO) and not practicality, which could be highly risky & frustrating.\r\n\r\n4. A lot many people say HR is a con/goon/irritating. But I must say, FC has got one of the best HR teams I have met in my career. They are ready to cross the bridges for things in their control. You ask them about salary/reimbursements, of course they don't know & since they are HR, it is their duty/KRA to retain you. Personally the HR Head has gone over board to help me for things under her control, every single time.",

(These Guys are serious about company hygiene).\r\n\r\nThe leadership team goes through the constant pressure for best of performance and team management on almost hourly basis. Since the company gets into financial crisis regularly, team motivation itself is the most important KRA for team leaders.\r\n\r\nFC is a power house of knowledge and learning. and doesn't allow much of the experimenting, so every time one needs to have a sure shot plan and there is hardly any scope of plan B.",
