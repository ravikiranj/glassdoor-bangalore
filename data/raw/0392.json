The organisation strives towards inclusivity in all its projects, but fails to realise that it needs to be inclusive within the organisation first. \r\n\r\n-There is a clear disconnect with what the founder aims for and how the middle management is manifesting this vision. \r\n\r\n-Absolute disregard for Human Capital.  \r\n\r\n-The organisation and its founders strive for a flat hierarchy but that is not evident when you start working. \r\n\r\n-The decision making process is undemocratic and is mostly done as per whims & fancies of one or a few. \r\n\r\n-The attrition rate is very high. Since the last 6-7 months, one person has left every month due to the above mentioned reasons. So don't be surprised if your colleague who was sitting next to you disappears all of a sudden. \r\n\r\n-You should not be surprised if a project is dumped on all of a sudden with out a proper handover process & documentation due to the above mentioned reason. \r\n\r\n-HR meetings will be conducted to hear out employee concerns, but if you raise genuine concerns, I must warn you that you will be ridiculed for the rest of your time there. During these meetings, it is not ensured that the non-english speakers are also enrolled in the conversation / discussion in its true essence. It appears as though the organisation had to conduct them as a mere formality to appease the supporting agencies. \r\n\r\n-There is very less scope for personal growth and building your professional capacity. All though the organisation claims that they will foster employee growth etc etc... when it comes down to getting approval to attend a cross-sectoral event, you will be bluntly shunned away. Please don't be disappointed when this happens to you. \r\n\r\n-If your english is not flamboyant,  you will begin to notice several doors will not be opened for you. Although, you will be asked to present in during internal meetings and you will be complimented with a round of applause.",
