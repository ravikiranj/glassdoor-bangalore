Great brands but with wrong hands. They will get into micro detailing of each and everything starting from work to travel to meeting to timings. sometimes they will force you to stay late and ask you to come on sundays ..\r\n3. No work life balance. Highest attrition . Any sales guy coming doesnt stay for more than 6 months. Its a record. The MD does micro management to the core and it is irritating some time.\r\n4. No perk, benefit etc.\r\n5. Seniors will bully you for each and every mistake.",
