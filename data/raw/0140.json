They were always there when I felt lost or needed help.\r\n\r\nEngineering:\r\nFundamentally, the company has a service oriented architecture (SOA) for its internal software systems.\r\nI had a good number of project opportunities and got exposed to important technologies such as Java EE, Spring, & Couchbase. This list has been growing as I explore new projects here.\r\nInitially I worked on a brand new project, which helped me learn to develop a web service from scratch.\r\nI also got to be involved in technology migration activities, which helped me understand the differences and nuances between old and new technologies.\r\nThere has been an increased focus on software quality by incorporating tools such as Sonar.\r\n\r\nTeam:\r\nMy team is brimming with experienced engineers: Senior Software Engineers and Tech Leads. We all have similar experience and mindset and come from diverse backgrounds. Working with them helped us establish professional friendship - we help each other out when needed.\r\nMore importantly, there are highly experienced engineers as well - Principal engineers & Architects. Working with them has been a great source of learning and inspiration.\r\n\r\nManagement:\r\nSenior technology management is easily accessible and has provided good direction when needed.\r\nThere are various internal tools that one can use to effectively communicate with senior business management as well for any other concerns.\r\n\r\nBenefits:\r\nAnnually an offsite trip is funded by the company, where a team can go on a vacation trip to a place of choice.\r\n\r\nWork-life balance:\r\nI have worked at a different e-commerce company before. Basis that I would like to comment that the work-life balance at MakeMyTrip is good.\r\nIn fact, it ranked #1 recently in work-life balance of all the e-commerce companies in India.",
