                    "cons": "Phew, after a lots of pros above, there are cons too. Cannot be perfect (yet).\r\n\r\nTraining: I've seen the studio grow from 30s to 150s in terms of employees. However, training provided in the team I worked on was poor (in other words, no training at all). It doesn't matter much because, I was hired on that terms. Although, there should be a stringent training program for few days for every new employee (I hope this is already fixed, as it has been a while since I left). \r\n\r\nLeadership: I sometimes could smell some favoritism towards compensations from upper-management. But, it didn't affect me much. I hope, everyone is treated well based on his/her merit and not on a \"Favorite\" basis. \r\n\r\nOne thing I found to be silly (never heard of this before in my entire career) was appraisals were done (at least for me) for 3 employees (one of the three is me) together in a room discussing their salaries and appraisals which I feel isn't right, this should be done privately with each one separately. How this affected me/us? These 3 employees knew each one's salaries and how much the other was appraised in terms of remuneration which created an irrelevant comparison between all 3. I got the least appraisal and hence I felt: either the other 2 were favored or I did not do good enough in comparison. This brought a lot of negativity in me and my work.\r\n\r\nBreakfast: This can sound humorous,not; breakfast wasn't that great :)",

                    "pros": "I've worked with Bitrhymes for almost 2 years and these years were gone before I noticed! I'd say, this here is like a ocean of knowledge and talent development. Most of the folks in the company are talented and open-minded. Personally, I would appreciate how the company is fueled by the upper-management, it is just amazing. Lots of positive morale around. If you are a fresher, working in this firm will not leave you disappointed, as your skills will have increased by some folds. \r\n\r\nTalking about culture, being situated in Bangalore, I saw people for various professional and cultural backgrounds rubbing shoulders together working as \"One single\" team. Although, there's a flat hierarchy, it is almost invisible as everyone in the studio is open to discuss anything from their line of work. For example: I could walk up to design team or marketing to share my ideas or ask them what I would want to know about their task/project, they wouldn't mind sharing at all. Upper-management loves feedback from employees and also, work on the feedback accordingly. Bitrhymes is an employee focussed company, so, if you are to join here, do not worry about job security. \r\n\r\nTalking about growth: As I mentioned earlier, this studio is really good to work with if you want to experience a complete development and production process. There are also options to transit to a different team if you are skilled for it (I had to face lot of hiccups for this and eventually, denied it). \r\n\r\nFUN: All the employees are fun lovers, name any Indian festival and the HRs will be ready with the arrangements. I personally love the Art team, they are just so joyous, buoyant and gleeful (not that other teams aren't ;)). There are many fun activities within the studio and quite a few team/studio outings every year. Even, there are lots of snacks and beverages provided. \r\n\r\nP.S: One of the best pros was/is the office timings.",
