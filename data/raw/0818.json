The most important thing i love about this company is the way they work, their culture and the way they encourage others to grow. Inspite of having hectic work schedule they help each other. Many times it happened to my self that senior people came, sat with me and solved my issues.\r\n\r\nFrom my point of view, the pros i found at Gizbel are,\r\n\r\n-Innovative work.\r\n-Growth and learning\r\n-Fun and Work\r\n-Flexible timings and transparency\r\n-and of course a good compensation",
