If you are a fresher and want to learn Recruitment for top product companies in India, then Pylon is the place to go!! \r\n\r\nSalaries are also better than most of the Search firms. In last 3 years there was not a single month when salaries came later than 5th of the month, usually between 1st to 3rd only. \r\n\r\nWork pressure and project deadlines are there in every company nowadays and Pylon is no different. My lead was very supportive and gave me a range of positions according to my interest and expertise area.\r\n\r\nManagement is flexible to employee issues and supports its employees at crucial junctures like Marriage, Maternity etc. Working from home option is also made available if required. \r\n\r\nGood, transparent incentive policy.",
