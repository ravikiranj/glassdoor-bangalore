Whilst their are many partners there remains an inner core of a group of older partners that cannot be trusted and will ruthlessly undermine those they do not like. They will lie directly to your face and act extremely unethically. Whilst the business puts on a facade of being design orientated it actually a very standard stale corporate business. It is bureaucratic with lots of paperwork and meaningless procedures that make project delivery difficult. In addition the environment is extremely political where back slapping and issuance of praise to the leaders is very necessary for promotion. The business wastes a lot and I mean a lot of money on useless marketing and publications to send illusions to clients on its culture and approach to design. Culturally it's like going to a cafe everyday where all design work is silo'ed into the hands of a few pretentious \"designers\". It's not a place for serious architects, and it's definitely not a people orientated business at its core. The business at times is very financially unstable, and a hire fire approach is core to its functionality.",

To top it all the current management of the office is terrible. The talent acquisition team is equally horrendous as they only hire people from bpo's or call centres. There is absolute no exchange of thoughts and ideas among colleagues. The atmosphere is terrible to work in. One can almost be choked to death!!!. They will snatch away your salary like greedy vultures from every way they can. Even if you have a proper planned leave sanctioned by your boss, the management will decide to chuck flat 2000buks from your salary. If one is late in logging into the UDT in once system  even five minutes past the schedule time more than three times in a quarter( yes you got me right ! In a quarter not a month), 1500 bucks from your quarterly performance bonus is gone!!!!!! Could anyone please explain the link between logging into the machine and your performance???!!! Yes,like I said my friends,this organisation is run by a bunch of uneducated and money sucking heads because they simply dont know how to set parameters for calculating performance bonus. They infact dont wanna give you any bonus, by setting up such senseless norms they just want your money to slide down inside their pockets!!!!! This company will draw blood money everything out of you!. You will neither build your career nor your pocket staying in this organisation.\nThis was just about the management and office in general. The managers and colleagues are very unpleasant to work with. Most of them lack work ethics and does not know how to behave in a corporate atmosphere.  You cannot call this place where one can socialise or feel proud of the people they met or got in touch with through cybertech. Please read the review and then decide carefully in making a move towards cybertech.\n\n--God bless the souls still captivated.",
