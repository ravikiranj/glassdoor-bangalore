Good and talented ppl are just the dummies. Its matter of fact I know some of them ;) \r\n5. Last 6 months around 10 ppl left the companies from a single team. You can guess the situation there. \r\n6. If you working at night , your team mates will assume you have watched movies and played games whole night.\r\n7. False promises are made during appraisal time. \r\n8. Some of the managers of the a team are not under even director of the team.\r\n9. amazing ratio. To look after and manage 5 developers 8 managers are there in a team.\r\n10.It doesnt matter what you are good at. you ll be given work randomly irrespective of  your talent and knowledge. \r\n11. Management spies are spread all across the office ;) just to know what you are talking about. \r\n12. Salary is not at all as per industry standers. Ya now I know ;) \r\n13.If you are talented and hard working and passionate about what you do Just go to some startup or other company\r\n\r\nI dont know guys I can go on and on and on but I think you must have made up your mind after reading these points so i dont think I should write anything else.",
