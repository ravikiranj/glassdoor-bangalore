India's management  is not able to manage Lancet so they started new business in the name of Scholite, providing BI training to freshers by promising job but that also failed as the cant give job to anyone.\r\n3.Poor Delivery lead:  doesnt know any thing about BI or DW.  can only talk in Telegu and if you can speak in Telegu then you will get good salary hike. \r\n4.We dont have any projects as we have lost most of the big projects to competition due to poor delivery.\r\n5. Management will only try to do staff augmentation. If you dont believe me then ask them in interview that which project will you work on? they will promise you some project but after you join then they will ask you to work for infosys or accenture or just sit on the bench.\r\n7.
