This has resulted in a greater sense of ownership and responsibility towards my role.\r\n2. Team-work is very prominent here. Due to the nature of the business, department cross-functionality is inevitable. Its interesting to witness sparring debaters in a conference room enjoy a coffee afterwards with each other with equal gusto!  \r\n3. The work timings are well structured. If i have some personal work, i can take off from work early. I can make up for the remaining hours of that day either in one shot or spread over the month.\r\n4. The employee benefits is a laundry list. But its safe to say that employees do appreciate them given the really long tenure of many folks here at Clinigene. Its quite a motivation for new employees.\r\n5. Very rarely would you come across a Contract Research Organization with these many services. Personally, i am getting a lot to learn and i am glad this is enriching my profile to a great extent",
