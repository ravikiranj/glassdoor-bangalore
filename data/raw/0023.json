We are getting good recognition special thanks to the Doc Manager who encourages us to try to innovate and supports during the process. Work is a little stressful but I have learnt a lot as compared to my past experiences with big companies. It was extremely challenging initially to bring in process. We have been collaborating actively with field teams to improve our documentation. Overall a great company where you can learn a lot.",

Snacks on the house every day with pay-use vending machine on the site!\r\n\r\nExcellent HR and communication team, and many business professionals are actually SMEs in their areas, so, it's not a surprise if you see yourselves immersed in intelligent and valuable conversations.\r\n\r\nLocation is good and secure - A lean team, but gives the feel and sense of a large sorted corporate organization.\r\n\r\nEnergy levels of employees are good to mediocre - not too loud, not way too subtle as well, just the right balance.\r\n\r\nThey are doing pretty good in the niche space they cater to, so I won't be surprised if they emerge as the next enterprise giant in the next 7-10 years.\r\n\r\nIf you are looking to make a stable career with the right amounts of work-life balance, go for Eka.",
