On this basis, I am writing this post & it doesn't require any more clarification ...\r\n\r\nI came in approx as the first employee of company 2 + years ago... I have seen the company hatching out of seed from day 1 till now & have enjoyed the journey so far . I can proudly make out a difference between where I was when I came in and  where I am right now. \r\n\r\nDunst never trimmed my wings and let me fly  and experiment  with multiple  things including developing mobile  applications, websites & structures, UI platforms, test platforms and  security solutions.\r\n\r\nAdvice to Management\r\nWe need to continue with our focus on high quality & timely delivery",
