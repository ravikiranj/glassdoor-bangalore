Few people still consider Dow Corning a great place to work, as confirmed by the latest employee engagement survey (mid 2012). But rather than reforming itself and setting up its employees for success, the company's priority seems to please investors through extreme staff reductions.\r\n\r\nAgree with previous comments that senior management is lacking in strategic thinking and has made several big decision mistakes in recent 2-3 years. This has cost the company dearly.\r\n\r\nOverly bureaucratic processes and culture. Archaic and labor-intensive claims substantiation process in place - contents of external documents must be approved by 5-10 internal reviewers, which can take up to one month! The result is a lack of market responsiveness and overtime for employees. Even for the smallest action, several formal approvals are required. \r\n\r\nDecision-making process painstankingly slow, linked to an ambiguous matrix organization. Staff themselves comment it has become impossible to have anything approved at Dow Corning. Marketing department has no budget and relies entirely on sponsoring from other departments. Very little scope for intiative or decision-making.\r\n\r\nOpaque evaluation process, lack of managerial accountability. Managers are evaluated by their peers (they can choose who evaluates them), not by their teams, with no real opportunity to provide feedback in case of inadequate management. This system fuels internal politics.  Remote management - a significant proportion of employees in some geographies only speak to their manager twice a month.\r\nCompany no longer providing adequate training for the commercial function. 80% of new recruits dismissed within the first two years in some geographies.\r\n\r\nOverzealous Legal department, linked to a chronic fear of litigation. More concern with making sure employees hold the rail when climbing up stairs to avoid any litigation risk than providing training or development opportunities.\r\n\r\nGeneral lack of resources. Project resources have reached alarmingly low levels, to a point where quality is affected.Travel budgets being cut further every semester, uneven distribution between regions and functions.  Archaic telecommunications system, no videconferencing.\r\n\r\nUnattractive office locations - Company selects areas based on local investment incentives. Several sites are abandoned industrial areas inacessible by public transport.",
