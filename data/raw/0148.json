I have seen many folks come and leave and if there is one thing that everyone who left would agree, it is that they were treated fairly by the management at Epiance. Everyone was given a long rope regardless of performance and instances of parting ways happened only after exhausting all possible alternatives. Epiance is not the place if one is just seeking a cushy job where one can sit around and do nothing, it is a give and take. If one wants to work in a not very highly supervised, trust based environment with no micro management and liberty to experiment and learn along the way, Epiance is the right place.  And many folks here, some of whom worked over 15 years with the company, would vouch for that.",
