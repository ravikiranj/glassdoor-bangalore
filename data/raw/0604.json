Bringing in military rules at work - Almost all sites are blocked, No MOBILES allowed(for freshers), Strict time entry and exit, forget social life, you wont live a normal life if you join here..\r\n3. You have to work like a donkey only to earn enough money to buy peanuts.\r\n4. Bad if not worst management. That moron HR is a lady who doesn't care about you.\r\n5.

The entire development cycle has become so process oriented that you loose interest in the way things progress. \r\n\r\nAlso, instead of focusing on work, people are more interested in office politics\r\nAny one gets in these days and there are not enough talented people around. Frankly speaking sometimes i feel disheartened when i see people taking so many tea breaks and just chatting there time at work.\r\n\r\nBut the biggest problem is meetings...!!! \r\nSeems like that is all what is done here. There are atleast 2-3 hours of meetings every alternate day and people discuss all crappy stuff there. I myself do not even see the point in most of these meetings but then if you frankly tell this to the management you end up in soup.\r\n\r\nIt pains me to think that CISCO such a giant in networking has come to this and has brought all the acquisition`s which function inside it to the same rut. \r\n\r\nI have decided to quit this BU and move to a start up where i can atleast do some meaningful work.",
