New oppportunities\r\n2. Developers can propose new technologies and you can explore them\r\n3.  If you give your best , EF will give you best perks\r\n4.  Managers doesnt do micromanagement\r\n5. I got best managers in Bangalore and Zurich(btw I worked /working for team Elektra)\r\n6. Good take home\r\n7. No heirarchy. Talk to anybody (System director, VP, CIO etc).\r\n8.  Team outings and party  every month\r\n9.  Weekend perks/ cabs and foods if you stay till 9.\r\n10. Some of the employees are technically sound and  we can learn lot from them.\r\n11. Deserved people will get good hike/promotions\r\n12. Company stands behind you if you are having tough personal problems, recently i saw company offered WFH option for a girl who just joined but had family health issues and provided support which company can give.\r\n13. Lot of trainings for employees with technologies/agile management\r\n14.Hackathon to showcase technical/new ideas\r\n\r\nLike every other company, I could see lot of bad review about the company, However i disagree with them and strongly feel those are the people who cannot work in a dynamic company.",
