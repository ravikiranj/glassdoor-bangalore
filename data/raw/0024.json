You think I am paid for writing reviews, I just got three words for you \u201cGOT TO HELL\u201d. This is an organization which has thought me many things from the scratch. I don\u2019t know why you guys start cribbing when you turn into ex-employee. You need to have guts to talk when you have an issue and sort out it right away.If you don\u2019t trust your managers, Did Mr.Roland tell you not to enter his room without his permission or an invite. He is always there to help anyone. I have seen him taking a suggestion from employees to make a better, learning and a successful environment. I would bet to any fresher this is a place where you can be molded! This statement is for current employees \u201cRecruitment is not easy\u201d. We are unique and our methodology is definitely different and nothing like it one will experience else where. If you think these mythologies are useless better retire now or else you will become another pain in our mission.",
