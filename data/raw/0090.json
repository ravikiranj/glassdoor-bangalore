Before joining Brickwork, I worked in a small Equity firm in Malaysia and was a CFA level 3 candidate, due to my husband's job transfer we landed up in Bangalore and I pursued BFA course to get hands on experience in credit industry.\r\n\r\nI must say BFA is one of the best course in India for the young graduates looking for an entry into credit industry as the Course not only teaches them Finance at par with the industry standard, but also gives them hands on Industry experience.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe MD of the organization himself takes most of the lectures and his lectures are excellent, he uses case studies from Harvard Business Review and I utilized this opportunity to max to enhance my knowledge. For example, there was a case study on NH-34 , where I came to know about the PPP structure, the risk and return characteristics etc. Now when the IRB Invt fund was opened for subscription last week, I was in a better position to judge its pros and cons of the fund and I subscribed it too! So most of the case studies they cover are used in day today life of any finance analyst (say whether you are into equity or credit ).\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the work front,  I was given BLR, NCD & MNRE mandates, where I gained practical knowledge. Here I like doing end to end work, whereas in other companies  you may end  up in doing only part of an assigned mandate.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Exam:  If the student lends his ears ( and understands the concepts clearly) during the BFA lectures, that itself is enough for him to pass level 1 and for level 2 , the questions which were done during the class needs to get practiced.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe value addition of BFA Course depends entirely on the student\u2019s utilization of the course ,as the lecturers are always there to help you when your are in doubt and also they encourage you to do the case study assignments.",
