It's not a good place to be if you're looking to just get by knocking off items in your task list alone.  It's not a 9 to 5 job either.  \r\n\r\nThe learning curve for the techies are a bit steep but that results in some seriously passionate coders who are an inspiration to many others like me.  Again, it's all about being self motivated here.\r\n\r\nThe senior employees are the best of the best at what they do and they are very approachable and I've seen some of them go out of their way to help employees with things in and outside work.",
