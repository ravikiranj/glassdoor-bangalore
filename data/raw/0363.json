Doesn't matter wether you are experienced or fresher, wether you know how the business works or no, wether you have contacts or no, BUT you need to have atleast 1 meeting everyday failing which a jobless chairman drops a text in a WhatsApp group saying, a day is wasted. A chairman, who was one of the BOD with zee telefilms sits all day and reads every text in that group which also has the Management who are puppets of the chairman.\r\nThey cheat clients by giving false Information of what they provide and by giving fake reports to clients who collaborate with them. \r\nThe employees too are supposed to be a part of this fraud to get money into the company. Anyways, all this sounds to be a traditional old school company operations. But the interesting part is yet to come. . . \r\nI was told that I would receive My F&F after 45 days of my last working day, and now it's been 70 days and the 45 days are yet to come.\r\nAt first when I started following up on the issue, I was being told that I would receive it in 3 days, then a week's time, and then the cheque was awaiting authorised signatures. I stopped calling and started mailing, and as expected there was no reply to 3 mails of mine until n unless I mentioned that I will be taking legal action against the company.\r\nI get a mail from the HR(Which she has tried to recall,but I had opened the mail by then) saying I will get it within a week's time followed by a call asking me to send an apology mail as the Management is really upset about me taking a legal action. She says she has the approved cheque but can send it only after my apology mail, that too without an assurance that I will get the cheque after I send (If) the mail. Will be filing a complaint with the labour dept now to take things forward.",
