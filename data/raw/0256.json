This is not easily accomplished, but having a flat organization with direct access to the founding team helps measurably. \r\n\r\nThe 3 founders are completely different in personality and skill set, but are equally committed to the growth of the company and its people, which is evident in how performance reviews are handled for example - a combination of anonymous peer reviews to get constructive feedback and an open/honest discussion with the founders/mentors on accomplishments and areas of improvement. The founders' passion for an inclusive India is palpable in conversations (sometimes in the style of open-forum debates), and traverses into the way in which Artoo hires for diversity (in every sense of the word). \r\n\r\n\u200bAnd that diversity is critical to developing creative solutions to improve access to finance for the underbanked. This was my experience at Artoo, as we went about addressing this mission - \r\n\r\n1) I developed an entrepreneurial spirit - At Artoo, it's encouraged and applauded to go beyond identifying problems or opportunities, to actually offer solutions and implement them (albeit in a scrappy/MVP sort of way). And doing so, provides insight into how to operate a startup - hiring the right people (recruiting is a group decision at Artoo), how to plan around resource constraints, building a new business function as the company & product scales, and celebrating even the smallest of wins (whether that's a great sales deck or a identifying the root cause of a plaguing bug in the software).\r\n\r\n2) I developed a deeper understanding of India & Emerging Markets - The number of field visits to talk to customers and customers' customers provided a great deal of insight into the challenges of industrial/manufacturing sectors, and how their growth is critical to India's economy. Understanding the perspective of a first time technology user is fascinating - and important when developing technology for the masses.\r\n\r\nThere's a lot to be done at Artoo. Things are certainly not perfect - selling software to banks is tough, sales cycles are indeed long and unpredictable, hours are long too. But, that's where the opportunity lies for authentic people to jump in, offer solutions, iterate, and see how the company as a whole moves forward, without losing sight of its mission.",
