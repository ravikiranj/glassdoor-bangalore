I'm not being discriminatory or aggressive, just stating the matter of fact.  Everything I say here is true and I can back it up with evidence if required. The cons, elaborated:\r\n\r\nWhile the company  does pay the salaries, it then believes that it own the employees. There's plenty of screaming and shouting and abusing, and when the need arises,  they'll change colours faster than a chameleon. The environment could change from euphoric to distressing in no time. To me, thus was all very new and unsettling. \r\n\r\nHere's a couple of true incidences:\r\n1. Employee lost his aim at the urinal, they used  cctv footage to track him, and shower him with public  humiliation. \r\n2. Employee applied for another job and they found out, he was fired on the spot. \r\n\r\n The company  also managed to have fake news of $6 million in funding do the rounds, they never got any. Imagine having to tell your friends and family that your employer lied to get attention and publicity.",
