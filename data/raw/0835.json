Flexible hours, very easy office/school tasks, even though it is diverse, but easy to learn and cope.  Able to learn about far more areas and department of the school rather that the only one we attend.\r\n\r\nManagement is great! We are able to become good friends and they are great counselors themselves, they give a helping hand to all the issues personal as well as school related.\r\n\r\nI really enjoy being at Capstone High School - Priya Bharani (K1 teacher)",
