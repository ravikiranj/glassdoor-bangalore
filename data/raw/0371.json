They change the policy based on the situation. They have a swipe IN/OUT policy which is not normal like \"First in Last Out\" in most companies, It checks every in/out and calculates the time. \r\n\r\nThe salary structure in this company is the worst meaning it is not employee friendly. You have to pay most as a tax. For example the maximum HRA in the company is below ~ 6K for any grade or designation.  And the Basic component is also very less below ~ 10K.
