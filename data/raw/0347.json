Eliminates work politics to a great extent. Plus, you get to know each and everyone really well.\n\nThe work will always have a bit of a challenge no matter how versed you are with your channels and stations. Thankfully, most of clients I came across were really helpful and understood the difficulties faced.\n\nGreat work from home policies and probably the highest number of leaves granted in any company I have worked so far.\n\nThe office space was lavish, in the heart of the Central Business District.\n\nFree snacks and beverages.
