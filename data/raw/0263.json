If it makes sense to you, it will be heard. You have the freedom to think out of the box and question the status quo. It's in this space that the team at CREO works best. Apart for ideas alone, you do get to experiment with new technologies and frameworks to suggest viable solutions.\r\n\r\nResources\r\nIf it helps you deliver faster, it'll be made available to you. These could be as trivial as an extra printer to that software stack that you have been eying all this time to a few extra team-mates to ease workflow. \r\n\r\nVariety\r\nThis is in terms of the day to day work as well as the kind of people you interact with. It's a great mix of product, tech, design, strategy, marketing, research , QA folks at CREO. If you are looking for feedback and perspectives to validate/invalidate your assumptions, you are bound to find fresh inputs by just walking to the next table. \r\n\r\nEmpathy\r\nThere is huge empathy within the team for each other as well as for the end consumer. It is which limits compromises and eases development from ideation to post production.\r\n\r\nAnd to add to this it's a great, fun place to work - Food, Amenities, Timings, the Vibe in general!",
