I found that Furlenco is not just a start up but it's a culture where every idea and decision find respect. Senior management and HR team are the best part of Furlenco, they have kept me motivated throughout the project on which I was working during the internship. I had full control on the project as I was allowed to take decisions related to the project. This helped me to explore things like Data Analysis, Process Design, supply chain management, communication skill, professionalism and most important love for the job. Employees of Furlenco are helpful and approachable. I am going to miss the lunch and cappuccino of Furlenco. At last, I will just say that I loved the job at Furlenco and it is one of the best options to do an internship.",
