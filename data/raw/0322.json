There are lots of constructive discussions where everyone gets an opportunity to present their ideas and learn from others.\r\n2. No monotonicity in work. One cannot get better quality and diversity of work as compared to qplum. There are 3 different teams working on different aspects of improving investment opportunities and experience for people around the world. \r\n3. The teams are relatively small with lots of responsibilities on every individual. This acts as a huge learning step.\r\n4. Opportunity to get involved with the next giants in the finance field!\r\n5. Good working atmosphere. People can lighten their mood with a quick game of foosball. There are frequent team bonding activities including fun games, outings etc",
