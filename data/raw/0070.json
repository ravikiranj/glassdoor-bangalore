I had heard horror stories from my friends about the work culture in Corporate India. On the contrary ET has been an awesome place to work. The culture at ET has been carefully nurtured such that we can be ourselves while we perform our roles. I am able to be myself here. I feel totally at home while at ET. For me, this is what I love most about ET. I love the fact that my freedom is intact. \r\n\r\nOne of the core values of ET stresses on \"happiness at the workplace\". I'm not sure how many companies in the world prioritise being happy at the workplace but it is a great value system and it encourages me to come to work every day. As an individual being happy is my most important goal and I'm very fortunate that ET supports it. \r\n \r\nResponsibility is equivalent to power at ET. Irrespective of one\u2019s age, experience, etc. the amount of power one commands in the organisation is equivalent to the amount of responsibility one takes. I love the level of transparency and democracy here. Things are openly discussed and all points of view are considered while making a decision. ETians have access to a lot of information which would not be available in any other organisation. ET is a true meritocracy. Merit is awarded and nurtured at all levels. \r\n \r\nThe way we celebrate personal achievements is awesome and the homely environment makes me love ET.",
