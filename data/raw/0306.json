In 3+ years I have experienced the expansion of employees/teams, offices, management , incentive programs, competitive benefit programs, an ongoing training curriculum and career path assistance.DS grew from a startup company to a mid level company where its services has expanded across Asia,Middle East,Africa and US.\r\nCulture is first and foremost at DS,senior leadership does everything they can to make every employee happy and come to work excited. They are also HIGHLY visible every single day, including the CEO interacting with the team and sharing the company's growth plan,vision etc.\r\nEmployees get to explore different technologies like BI,ETL,Data Analytics etc which will really help them to grow their career .In DS there are lot of career development programs where managment focus on improving employee's technical and interpersonal skills.\r\nThis had helped us as an empoyee in DS to become a Consultant/Manager rather than becoming  a programmer or a developer.\r\nEach and every employee gets an opportunity to work with the customers directly there by getting the exposure to their environment.\r\nConsultants travel frequently to customers site across India,Asia,Africa,Middle East,US etc.\r\nAll my colleagues are very self-motivated, everyone knows what is necessary to get things done.\r\nI can't imagine a better place to work as long as you are more interested in meaningful, challenging, exciting work than pure compensation. \r\n\r\nChase Your Dreams with Data Semantics !!!!!!!!",
