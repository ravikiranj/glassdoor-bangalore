The CEO Urvesh thinks he is a General, running a special ops unit. but has no talent, brains, attitude, expertise or even interest in doing it. \r\n\r\nHere's what happened to their Bangalore office, They didn't pay rent for 3 months so the building owner kicked us out after 3 months of non payment and kept their deposit (which was equivalent to 3 months rent) and some stock valued at 80,000 rs to be adjusted towards committed monthly bills and facilities. The awesome part is that the management still thinks that the deposit must be returned and not be adjusted towards rent as its technically called \"deposit\" but completely fails to understand this happened only coz they didn't pay their rent. In their minds everyone is bad but they are awesome. The CEO used company money and bought a Toyota Camry Hybrid 2016 model in Hyderabad in black color. On road price of around 40 lakhs, this was paid in full at the purchase but when it comes to paying salaries its always delayed. Salary delays have been happening since 3 yrs regularly and after calculating the total payouts annually i realize that instead of getting 12 payouts in a year you get around 5 to 7 payouts depending on your position or priority. Basically 2-3 months delay between payouts is a regular and a normal scene. They also bought an Innova in 2016 in dark grey color in Hyderabad using company money stating that this is for employees to travel around for work. they have used both the vehicles to come to Bangalore.",
