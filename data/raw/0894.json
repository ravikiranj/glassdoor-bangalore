The CEO personally told me that the situation would look very messy and chaotic but all I would expect u to do is be calm and absorb as much as you can ... woah which org says that.... week after week I was motivated, though not required or asked for but feels good for sure .... I have now completed 3+ months in this company and I am proud of myself to work with such amazing people and founders.\r\nEveryday at work is fun, challenging and a huge amount of creativity involved. A place where your point of view is listened to, you are allowed to experiment, your suggestions are valued and a place where u get to take the ownership of your task before being questioned.",
