They made sure I\u2019m working on stuff that I enjoy the most and could contribute the most back to the company\u2019s growth.\r\n** Transparency at its best. Each employee knows how much profit the company is making, what are the company goals and working towards it as a team. And with an open autonomous salary system, there is no room for any dirty politics. This acts as a forum to build trust with the company\r\n** Continuous career growth is the key. Weekly one-on-ones and OKRs help everyone to focus on growth of  the company and the individual.\r\n** Challenging and purposeful projects. Always working \u2018on-the-edge\u2019 technology forces everyone to learn new things everyday. Everyone in the team talks to their customer and has the chance to voice their opinions/suggestions on the product.\r\n** Me being a travel enthusiast, I always had the support to go on my yearly 2-week road trips or expeditions. Well, it needed planning in advance so that it does not create huge gaps because of my absence.",
