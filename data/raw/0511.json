Employee's merit is not at all considered.\r\n3. Employee's skill, talent or seniority have no imimportance, because if there are layoffs, the favorites survive, and the others, no matter how important their role is, are first to get fired. \r\n4. Bad work environment. Most of the HR policies are openly violated. Employers have no respect for the employees, including seniors and women.",
