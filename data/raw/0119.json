Overtime working is similar to other places but it has many facilities like TT, xbox, apple TV, HTC vive and carrom if you r looking for fun in ur free time.\r\n\r\n I have seen people complain about management or type of work given but it is not same for everyone. Some are having good time and some are having bad time. I guess it all depends on what kind of project u will get. For freshers, there are some really good developers here unless they all leave at once. They can learn a lot from them compared to any other place. \r\n\r\nEven if the level of the company is not near to any of the Big MNC companies, still there have been all kinds of clients and sometimes those same big companies relied on company to do the projects. So who have worked with them, know how things are handled in those companies and trying to bring the same kind of environment here.\r\n\r\nBest thing is we get all kind of projects starting from 2d games, board games, casual games, 3d games, simulation games, apps in unity, porting projects (although i hate to have these but lot can be learned by digging into others code) and PC games and TV games.\r\n\r\nRegarding salary, i believe they don't give much to anyone who is joining the company freshly but if u do good throughout ur probation and until next hike, u will get a very good hike.",
