Happy to be a part of the journey.\r\n\r\nHiring Process is  very interesting and challenging. And some one who loves problem solving will really enjoy the process.\r\n\r\nAs my previous company was service based, my managers lacked problem solving and programming skills. But In Whatfix Problem solving is an important part of the culture and even our HR lead is so good at problem solving and programming. I was awestruck by the experience. \r\n\r\nWhat we get at Whatfix\r\n- Great learning curve.\r\n- Getting to meet inspiring people\r\n- Amazing work culture\r\n- Like minded people\r\n- Build high quality software\r\n\r\nWhatfix is a complete package.
