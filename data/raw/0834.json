                    "cons": "-Very unprofessional and Bad Mouthed Principal\r\n- Regional Biased to Christianity and people from Kerala\r\n-Unprofessional Principal's Staff maintaining Attendance of Teachers and Salaries.\r\n-Unhygienic place for kids of primary and pre-primary school.\r\n \r\nI was appointed as a Primary school teacher at St. Francis ICSE school, Hongasandra branch, Bangalore-560068. The school timings were 8:05 AM - 4:00 PM 6 days a week.\r\nAs per this school rules and regulations, second Saturdays of the month was off day, but it was very rarely that it was declared as holiday. My appointment was as a Assistant teacher but i was given the responsibility of the Main teacher and with additional higher classes to be taught for the same salary within 10-15 days of my joining. It is my humble request that if you are a mother with kid aged 1 - 8 years, you should never join this school as if you take a leave of for any health problems of your kid or family member even once in month, they will threaten to resign. I took a leave off when my kid was unwell due to infection, Brother Cletus didn't had any ears to listen and said that I was lying and should resign very next day. I am very much settled in my life and was doing the job as i had interest and teaching, so I handed over my resignation letter to the Brother Cletus mentioning to pay all my dues till date, provide me the acceptance of Resignation/ Relieving letter and  provide me my Provident Fund Details. At the very first he accepted to do so and told that after a week I will be given my Relieving Letter. When I went the very next week, he was so arrogant that he told why do I come to school every time and took a U-turn on his previous words of providing the Relieving letter. He told that for teachers staying less than a year, we do not provide any Experience Certificate/Relieving Letter. I questioned saying that if you even worked on Probation period for at least 3 months and resigned properly, you have to provide the relieving letter to any employee. Not to mention that he even asked through one of the coordinator of the primary wing stating that if I am willing to work on the lower salary which in my eyes is a very cheap behavior.\r\n\r\nBefore me there was another primary teacher who was not from the southern part of India and she was also asked to resign and leave the school before the next salary hike. Brother Cletus is a very arrogant and bad mouthed person who always wants to get teachers every year or half yearly on same payroll. For this he tries all the hook and crook to find or cook a mistake to throw out the teachers. The school office management has no courtesy to talk to the teachers staff. Please also have a note  if the teachers do not accompany on any trip visit far and outside of the City for e.g. Chennai or Mumbai, Brother Cletus will ask the office staff to deduct every month from the salary of the teachers the amount for the expense of each teacher for trip. The school environment is pathetic, as the teachers will be asked to pay from there salary to get the teaching material printed and photocopied. In one of the addressing by Brother Cletus he even told the staff teachers that students in this school come from very high standard families and not lower standard families of the staff teachers. The principal Brother Cletus considers that teachers teaching here are working because they have family problems and that is why they come from low standards family. The day I was asked to put resignation, same day have fired another teacher from higher standard who joined close to my joining date and was getting an average salary. If the Principal cannot afford to pay the whole year then why should he hire the staff.\r\n\r\nKids beware that such a principal is playing with academics of the students when there subject teachers will be thrown out of the school in the mid of the session. Post my leaving of the school now there is no teacher for my replacement and principal has asked another teacher who knows nothing about that subject to teach to the students such is the students plight.\r\n\r\nTo tell you about the school pathetic environment for the primary kids. The school bathroom is located very near to the primary classes Nursery, LKG and UKG and it is a very unhygienic place for the kids with foul smell always coming to the class. Please refrain from getting your kids admission in this school if you are a teacher there as if any problems are created by him or your work condition, then your kid is definitely going to suffer in his academics as Brother Cletus will make it happen. This is a real incident which I have seen here with two of the teachers.",
