I commissioned only 3 times there and I was essentially the assistant manager without the title or $2 in extra pay. That leads me to the pay. Yes we don't do a lot, but that's because not a whole lot of customers come in. When they do, it's a flood and very hard to manage especially when your coworkers aren't the best at the job. It also is very stressful when mistakes are made and you have no idea what the circumstances are. It is very disorganized. \r\n\r\nYou will also blow through your dress shoes, and your discount is not significant enough to replace them. \r\n\r\nCatalog department is impossible to get through to.\r\n\r\nPOS (no pun intended) removes features weekly that make your job more difficult and makes getting used to the system hard.\r\n\r\nWhen you run out of receipt tape, you have spam IT till they pick up and then remote in to reset your register. It's pretty much useless until then.\r\n\r\nYou are very tempted to buy the products with your discount but realize you have other expenses",
