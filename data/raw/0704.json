The work is almost non-stop and never seems to end, and many a time you have to keep working late into the night to clear the files, and there are times when I have worked on Sunday as well!! Forget overtime pay, even rate of incentives is very less. Ever since I joined here, my personal life is practically non-existent.\r\n\r\nAnother major drawback is that there is no intimation whatsoever by the HR or anyone else about holidays. Employees are supposed to login and check for work even on a holiday (other than a Sunday thankfully). Employees not familiar with this rule end up losing attendance.\r\n\r\nAlso, their concept of \"appraisal\" is very smart and ridiculous--an employee gets a raise only if he/she agrees to take on more work than they are actually doing at present. in other words, no matter how experienced you are, it is of NO USE.",
