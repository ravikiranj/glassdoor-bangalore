                    "pros": "I am a senior Interactive Developer associated with Echidna from very long time and I thought of sharing my experience over the social review platform \u201cglassdoor\u201d which can help the viewers to understand more about the culture and facts of Echidna \r\n\r\nReason behind me posting  opinions: One of my old friend\u2019s got an opportunity in Echidna and he dialed me to validate the concerns he has about the negative reviews regarding Echidna over Glassdoor which triggered me to read the reviews on Glassdoor where negative reviews are not 100% correct which  surprised/shocked me\r\n\r\nFact to be agreed: After all this is a social platform which opens the wide opportunity to express every individuals opinion very transparently and at the same time it leaves good amount of chances for few employees to manipulate the reality with their frustration which is just situational instinct and I would like to clarify the authenticity of the reviews to the viewers as an senior most employee of Echidna. I personally feel that it\u2019s my responsibility to clarify the ambiguity of many new joiners regarding what has been listed in this forum\r\n\r\nI would like to address one of recent posts which cover most of the concerns \r\n\r\nConcern 1: No Promotions & Unequal Growth\r\n\u2022\tAs a company Echidna\u2019s grown on multiple folds over the last 7 years\r\n\u2022\tAll the talented people associated with Echidna has been rewarded with Industry best salary, promotions, Onsite \r\no\tEchidna is a high talent density firm where all the eligible employees receives the promotions\r\no\tWe don\u2019t import leaders from outside rather we groom and manufacture them with in Echidna  - 4 years experienced highly talented developer leads a domain of 30+ team , 5 years experienced dynamic developer taking the responsibility of Magento team , 3 Years\u2019 experienced BA is heading the Business Analyst team \u2013 these are few examples which prove that talent is highly rewarded and employee\u2019s talent recognized is nurtured and transformed into a leader\r\no\tDo any company offers an onsite to 1 year industry experienced employee? Trust me Echidna offered to many \u2013 I am one of them\r\no\tIn fact there is no developer or tester with 3 years\u2019 experience in the company without a single promotion  \r\n\r\nSo, Concern of \u201cNo Promotion & Growth\u201d is FALSE allegation. \r\n\r\nConcern 2: Inefficient Project Delivery Model & Process\r\n\r\n\u2022\tCan a company grow from 4 employees to 200+ employees in just 6 years bagging the projects of Worlds Retail biggies like \u201cKohl\u2019s\u201d without a proper delivery model?  \r\n\u2022\tIn fact we designed our own highly successful customized project delivery models to meet the competitive timelines which made our clients delighted and the result of this we still manage Support & Maintenance for most of our clients and Our NPS ratings are far higher than industry average\r\n\r\nSo Concern of \u201cProject Delivery Model & Process\u201d is FALSE allegation\r\n\r\nConcern 3: Female employees are not respected and mistreated\r\n\u2022\tOut of 7 key leaders of our company \u2013 3 are WOMEN and this shows levels of  respect and equality to women\r\n\r\nSo Concern of \u201cFemale employees are not respected and mistreated\u201d is FALSE allegation\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t say that we are 100% perfect, we do have challenges as we are very fast growing company but still all these concerns are taken care by our leadership team  and management is working on solving those minor hiccups and as a senior employee I am witnessing the change\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned earlier - it\u2019s unfortunate that sometimes facts are tampered out of situational frustration \r\n\r\nPlease don\u2019t believe in false allegations \u2013 contact our awesome HR team and cross validate with our Echidna employees if you have any mutual connections to know the FACTS",
