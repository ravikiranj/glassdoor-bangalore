Later , when i joined corporate, i realised, this only helped me to become a better performer.Not only got a chance to work in MNC, but got double promotion. \r\n\r\nBeleiev me all these negative feedbacks on Glassdoor are not worth considering, if you want to do well in your career.\r\n\r\nfocus on your own learning and growth if you are serious abt your career",
