                    "pros": "Undoubtedly the people. Although for a short period, you would have the opportunity to meet a lot of them because of the continuous movement.. Out and In\r\n\r\nNow for the pros that are really worth all the praise: Wooqer\u2019s mighty product & Wooqer\u2019s efficient people management skills\r\nSome of the highlights of this mighty product: #1Unpredictability: Wooqer is always full of surprises. Nobody really knows how it's meant to function. It leaves the Wooqer users and  the bug fixers on tenterhooks. Wooqer\u2019s capacity to surprise is at its highest during that important demo/presentation that you so want to nail. If you are a seasoned player, like the Wooqer Godfathers, you will maneuver the whole situation in your favor. If you are a newbie (onboarding takes a year) your facial expressions will just give it away. Hard luck newbie.\r\n#2DIY: Massive respect for this product for its honesty. It openly claims it's a  DIY product(Do it Yourself). Why not? From the testing stage, it is the responsibility of the customer to do it themselves. Wooqer will bear no responsibility from thereon.     #3UI.. Wow.. Just Wow! So intuitive that the users begin onboarding by reading a 30  page  \u2018How to use Wooqer?\u2019 guide available in different colors(must mention the colors, because everyone in wooqer creates a guide in their favourite color and presents it to the customer). There\u2019s some relief for the color blind too. Wooqer offers its introductory guides in video format, also mutli-language..   #4Mobile App: Wooqer\u2019s web version has a sidekick- The Mobile App. Now this one is a star. Remember the days when your parents/spouse complained that you are always fiddling with your phone? Wooqer App will make this go away. Just install the Wooqer App. Your phone will turn into a needy child that seeks constant attention sending you incessant absolutely unnecessary Wooqer notifications. The day you register your number with Wooqer, you are doomed.You leave wooqer, uninstall the app, erase all signs of your digital existence, yet- Wooqer will hunt you down and send you a notification, suggesting/begging  you to login.. Curse it and crush it! We hates it forever!     #5Security: Wooqer is a private internet with everything available publicly. Customer sales data, internal employee salary information and what not. It's a very secure open secret.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow for Wooqer\u2019s people management skills:\r\nAre you feeling unmotivated just like all the other employees in Wooqer. Fear not the famous Wooqer townhall is here, where the God fathers talk for hours on how Wooqer is making astronomical numbers with  handful customers, that delusional  pomp and show ought to make you feel better. Want more comfort? Here, take a Wooq(originally woof,but that's downright inhumane and nasty, so Wooq), that beaming piece of white worthless paper to make you feel better. On a totally unrelated topic, how many of us have bought the loyalty of a stray animal by feeding it a Parle-G?\r\nDrifting back, so you are still unmotivated, your yearly hike is overdue ? So you decide to do something about it, you first write a `talk` to your manager, after a month-an email, after 2 months-you just corner her and ask her: hey lady manager, where\u2019s that  yearly pea sized hike I was meant to receive? Now she panics and opens all your colleagues salary slips (#security) and shows you  how much more you get paid and how you should thank your stars for it and work 25 hours a day to  really deserve it .. If  this can\u2019t motivate you, nothing can.\r\n\r\nWooqer\u2019s last noteworthy item is the proactive accounts section. Did you want to get all your documents (PF, Form 16) straightened out when you left the place? You will never succeed. It's like pursuing that hot girl who is just way out of your league. So man up!",
