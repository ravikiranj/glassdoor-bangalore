Similarly each director has less than 20 reportees. In other companies a manger/senior manger will have 20 reportees. Ruckus is wasting money on managers, directors and VP's.\r\n*During Brocade acquisition, they have given 10000 RSU's per engineer, but was given only to few select engineers who spend more time with managers projecting themselves than doing the actual work. 90% of the current staff have joined Ruckus in the last 1 or 2 years. Out of 150 engineers in Bangalore, only 15 have worked for more than 4 years in Ruckus. Most of the old folks left as they were not given RSU's and rest of them are new to Ruckus.\r\n*During Arris acquisition, they mentioned that they will pay for all unvested RSU's. So for employees who got RSU's it is like lottery. They will get around 50 lakh cash due to Arris acquisition. The RSU's were given by Brocade less than 6 months back and vesting time was 4 years, but Arris told they will pay immediately during acquisition and no need to wait for 4 years.\r\n*Arris will do a major layoff in next 6 months. It is good if they target employees who got RSU's and managers. Both of them have got lottery and they won't get affected as they have lot of cash. I think Arris employees have to work 4 to 5 years to make that kind of money which Ruckus employees made in 6 months.\r\n*VP's/Directors/Managers are indulging in needless travel. All the indian employees working in US come to India with company paid tickets. In 3 weeks, they come to bangalore office for 2 days just to claim the air tickets.\r\n*Just to accomodate their friends and colleagues from previous company, they create new openings and recruit them. Most of the VP's/Directors/Managers know each other and have worked together earlier.",
