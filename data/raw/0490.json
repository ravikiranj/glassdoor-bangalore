SME's were actually working hard and keeping customers in check.  I was not a RSA;  was a PA but I have seen the condition of RSA's it was pathetic. Till the Time there were SME's in USA at least they were able save some  face in front of the customer. Now Indian RSA's are not even able to save their own face leave aside saving a PA from customers. \r\n\r\nall you will learn here is their internal tools (no value in job market)\r\n\r\nThere are Indians sitting in upper management, any one who has experienced this will tell you what it means.
