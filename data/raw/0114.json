Having multiple job options in hand, felt inclined to join Applift with opportunities to work on distributed,scalable,high load n throughput technical challenges after meeting senior tech persons whom I found extremely grounded and supportive. Till date , have not felt differently from what i had perceived. My experience till now in bullet points :\r\n-> Opportunities to work on latest tech stack almost in all development teams. Got to work on many latest open source Apache community projects.\r\n-> Supportive and friendly environment with freedom to work as per individual\u2019s working style. Options being given to choose project as per skill sets and interests. Have seen Scrum timings  being changed  to cater team member's convenience .\r\n-> Opportunities to take full ownerships of projects if one works responsibly.  Credit is given honestly to the deserved ones.\r\n-> Good initiatives like ITP(International Talent Plan) which give frequent chances to performing employees to travel to other international offices of Applift and interact and learn with them.\r\n-> Work from home easily available. Work life balance is in place, Weekends/Vacations are respected except rare production issues.\r\n->  Free Lunch, snack,juices, breads,cereals. Cant ask more for free.\r\n-> Awesome green location at Koramangala with beautiful interiors. Not a typical tech park boring surroundings. However,  its an individual\u2019s choice.\r\n-> Talented and easily approachable peers , anyone can reach out to anyone anytime for help. Equally good in playing video games n TT together.\r\n\r\nP.S.   felt compelled to share personal experience after seeing some recent feedbacks  with vested interests aimed at maligning company. Hope to see more employees coming forward with their share of genuine experiences.",
