The company is flexible if you want to stagger your work hours but since the cab facility follows this shift timing, practically this is the shift everyone follows so you are kind of forced to follow it. It's supposedly kept to keep overlap of work hours between India and U.S, but this is kind of unfair to India employees, especially if they have families. U.S employees get to start early and spend  time with their spouses and kids but India employees often find it difficult. At least whrn the overlap of day hours is more due to the daylight savings cycle, they can make it a little earlier here\n-Next level of leadership after Anil Yadav is inconsistent. Some function heads are very good and professional but others are not\n- No proper policies in place to deal with improper or bad behavior. Surprisingly there is no ombudsman reporting mechanism and many people get away with very bad behavior because superiors don't take complaints about them seriously",

Instead of a 9 hour shift you work for 12-13 hours a day, forget the appreciation you don't even get considered for the efforts you have put in. If you have an opinion and want to bring it on table then Lancesoft is not at all a right place to work, rest of you want to just earn money on the stake of loosing your self respect then with all dues Good Luck!",
