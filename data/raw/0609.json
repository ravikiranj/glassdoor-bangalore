Why?\r\n-&gt; Most people would interpret constructive criticism as an effort made by other people (who are as busy as you are), to help you grow and move forward in your career.\r\n-&gt; Some people tend to interpret such advice and criticism as complaints. These are the people who think whatever they do is right, that there is no more improvement to be done to their work, and usually like to live in a comfort zone rather than grow their career by putting in effort. These are also the same people whom I believe might have been asked to put in their papers, and as a result are ranting at Glasdoor.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, if you don't accept that you can improve by listening to advice and criticism from others, there is only so much the company can do. At the end of the day, this is a business that needs to keep running.\r\n\r\nOther pros:\r\no Very good work environment, and no delayed salary days like some of the competing companies in this sector\r\no Great co-workers\r\no Enough freedom to work the way you want -- provided you perform to expectations\r\no Great mentoring and teaching by senior managers and top management\r\no Constructive criticism and appreciation without any office politics involved\r\no Small but wonderful team to work with and learn from",
