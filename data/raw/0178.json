It seemed like a YAD (Yet Another Division) till it actually spun off and became it's own entity. Initially, there was chaos, and lot of heartache, as is to be expected in any such transition. But over time it has now settled into a really focused, nimble company where you can see your efforts translate into results for the company - sometimes almost literally thanks to the Deal Wall. I've worked in several companies before, and I know how hard it can be to connect dot A: your work to dot B: your company's results. \r\n\r\nThe other thing I like about Pulse Secure is the pace at which you get to build new features and mini-products. I think it was Steve Jobs who said Real Artists Ship. I've found many real artists here. :)\r\n\r\nAnd some really funny people too.",
