It\u2019s been 1.5 year with the organization and the moment I am posting this comment, I am glad to point out about the work culture here. The best part is the flexibility of work and work from home option that helps to balance the work and personal life. The management & coworkers are helpful, kind and professional. It\u2019s been a great journey so far and the same is continuing with the team. In that small period I have seen a tremendous growth in my personal & professional life. \r\n\r\nOne of the interesting thing in Optiv is the Open door policy that the Management follows and encourages the people to follow. Transparency in the work, which is lacking in many companies, has been overcome by Optiv. You will find complete transparency in work and you can ask any questions to anyone no matters where you stand in the Hierarchy. \r\n\r\nOptiv is a company with best culture and work ethics. We all work as a family and enjoy the fun time together along with work. I think the biggest accomplishment of Optiv (Bangalore) is Zero attrition in last 4 years which I've never seen in any company.\r\n\r\nIf you want to grow your career in IT Security and want to work with one of the worlds biggest security company, come and Join \"Optiv\" and I bet you will never regret your decision. You will get everything to prove your skill sets and will get exciting and challenging responsibilities with great work life balance. \r\n\r\nI strongly recommend you to join Optiv and taste the flavor of \"SUCCESS\"",
