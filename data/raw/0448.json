Dedicate yourself and give it time, You will become master at your craft in a couple of years or less. Whenever you are stuck, binu is always there. I have never heard him saying I dont know that, Be it Python, Java, Javascript you name it he knows it.\r\n\r\n2. You can find a great friend in Vinodh, though my shy and natural ways stop me from being so close. but I know deep inside he will be there when you need him.\r\n\r\n3. Great working atmosphere and challenging projects/product to work on. You will be a front end developer, back end dev, devops guy and everything for your project. That gives you a great platform to learn different technologies at the same time.\r\n\r\n4. Great bunch of youngsters, from an IoT guy to HP guy and Beta. you will find everyone so unique and helpful in their own way and you will have a great time working here.\r\n\r\n5. Foosball, we are looking to expand our foosball team. Currently we have stars in the lineup with Arun leading the show most of the times. we are looking for a really good goal keeper.",
