When I started I was new to the company, the role, and, truthfully, had no idea what I am going to do! Whether it is my manager, desk neighbor, or anyone in the entire org, EVERYONE is SO open to helping you! This company really goes above and beyond to make sure their employees work hard and get rewarded for their efforts. \r\n\r\nOne of the components I love is the ability to work from home. While I do not take advantage of this because I love coming into the office to work, I was sick for three days of a week and my manager encouraged me to stay home. I decided to work from home and even then he was checking in to make sure I was getting enough rest and not overdoing it. Going off of this, the work/life balance is great!\r\n\r\nIf you are looking for great company culture, a CEO/CTO who actively engages with the entire organization, and a company you can grow with, Magnitude Software is for you!",
