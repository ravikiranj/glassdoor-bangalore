One of the biggest pro's in my opinion was the trust that is given to an employee by the management, this really gave me a sense of ownership in whatever task i was assigned. I was able to sense good team spirit amongst colleagues who shared responsibilities and this enabled a great work atmosphere. Being that it is a start up, a good performer can grow exponentially and no good effort goes unnoticed. I had worked closely with the CEO and found him to be an extremely good leader & mentor and this also rubbed off on other employees. He was very transparent and approachable, as were other colleagues. Owing to the previous points, i was able to take away immense learning and experience in a short of time. I've no doubt that this organisation with it's young workforce and fresh ideas will go from strength to strength. \r\n\r\nTLDR:\r\n-Great place to work!",
