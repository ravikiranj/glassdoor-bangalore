Here's what I like about MathWorks - \r\n\r\n1. Privately held & profitable. Great work culture, not at all hierarchical, is similar across all locations. In fact, it took me a bit a time to adapt my work style to this non-hierarchical work setup. :) Management is very open to listening to you & taking action on genuine concerns.\r\n\r\n2. Colleagues you work with are very bright, yet easy to approach and are not judgmental\r\n\r\n3. Managers encourage you to build a long term career. Intra-departmental transfers are NOT discouraged. Yes, seriously! I know of managers in other companies where you are treated like an untouchable if you speak the dreaded word \"transfer\". :) >50% of employees have been with MathWorks for 5+ years and that's something!\r\n\r\n4. EDG (Application Support Engineer) is a superb program for fresh engineering graduates. Have seen similar programs in other companies but what makes this different is that the company empowers these fresh graduates to make their own choices and build their own career path in the company. They learn MathWorks products from customers' perspective by providing them technical support. They can choose from a variety of cool internal projects to work on to identify the next technical role they want to be in for the longer term. \r\nSome reviews here about EDG/ QE are in poor taste, frankly! Probably the authors had a very narrow focus in their career and did not relate to company's culture of sharing feedback openly within the company. Hopefully with more maturity and experience at other companies, they may realize what they missed out on! Wish I had something similar to EDG when I started out.\r\n\r\n5. Good work-life balance. Performance is rewarded",
