Also too many last-minute changes. Holiday & other policies are to penalise than to motivate! Now that Saturdays are off, company has cut down on annual leaves and discarded the comp offs when employees are made to work way beyond office hours, which on paper are 930-730 (that's actually illegal under Labour Laws). But towards every project end, employees stay back until 1/2 am; wk sat & sundays (on some occasions). Founders often don't know where they are headed or more importantly, how to reach where they're headed. this leads to miscommunication; lack of clarity in work; waste of time & effort. Watch out your salary offers - a big part is variable n not payable till u complete a year.",
