Having worked for bigger organisations in the past, there was always the nervousness of joining a new company, especially knowing the fact that it was a start up. However, having heard the vision and mission of the founders I took a bold step to join their journey that would enable people to make better decisions regarding this investments and wealth. Looking back, I can very well say that the decision that I took about 12 months back was the right one.\r\nHaving had a career that spans close to 25 years, one may think that \u201cyou have seen it all\u201d. However the past 12 months have proved that wrong. Everyday is a new day and you always get to learn something new. \u00a0\r\nIn terms of technology, we have adopted an advanced architecture, cutting edge technical stack, and the methodologies are innovative. The turnaround time for any of our tasks are phenomenal. \r\nThe team here great and ever helping. Having said that, no day goes without a discussion on \u201cwhat is the best ways to solve a problem at hand\u201d. The founders have been very supportive and have created an environment that brings out the best from an employee.",
