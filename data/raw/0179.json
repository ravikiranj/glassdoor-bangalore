Some negative reviews are so exaggerated and looks like it is written by those who left due to non performance. It is a process oriented company. All leads and managers are very helpful and guide us a lot. But they are strict and non performing recruiters might not like them which will be the same in any company. Someone wrote above that company lost vendorship with TCS. It is wrong. Even now we are having all contract and full time requirements from TCS. If you like to work hard, and grow and learn, this is a good place.\r\n\r\n-Highly experienced leads with extensive experience.\r\n-Friendly and helpful management\r\n-Multiple Internal training for improving the skills\r\n-Fun activities/gift vouchers\r\n-Good office \r\n-Transportation(pick up and drop)\r\n-Free snacks",
