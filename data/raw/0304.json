I have earlier worked with large and medium size companies but I think working in a startup like ROKITT is one of the best decision. If you are looking for a relaxed kind of job then this is not a place you should look for. The best part is that you work on latest technologies. You feel sense of ownership and get to work with best talents of industry. You can reach to any higher authority for any concerns. It is a flat organization. Due to Management\u2019s vision and hard work of team, ROKITT is named as one of the Top 10 Banking Analytics Solution Providers in 2017 by Banking CIO Outlook magazine. I am proud to be a part of such talent.",
