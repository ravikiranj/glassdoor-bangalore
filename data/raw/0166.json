We are given so much to do in terms of work and we work on multiple projects at the same time which i feel is as good as getting 3 years of experience in one year. beleive it or not guys i have worked on Integration project of MS Dynamics CRM and a Soft telephony application integration at my 6th month of experience in this company. which company gives such an exposure. Today i am a Master in CRM. I just love this company",
