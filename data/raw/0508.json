Some people with no knowledge are appointed as managers. Such managers are a burden on company. Recruitment process is non-standard. They are far away from psychological screening of the candidates. The rules are very rigid in case of leaves. The management have no knowledge that such atmosphere will suppress the creativity and employees will not be stable here. They lock the doors which will open in breaks only. It is like jail. The tea break and dinner break are for half an hour only. Mobile phones are not allowed inside the office. Kindly think twice before joining this organization. Once the management asked to come for 10 hours for one month and they didnt give overtime which is unethical.",

The Leadership team is very accessible and they understand the ramp up time required by Individuals to set up in the organization. I come from very large organization where everything was through a set process, But to my surprise SevOne had all those processes already in place and in fact in many cases they are better than any of the other organization I worked for. For e.g. Day 1 and My 1st Hour in the company, they set up my Laptop, Email, My Salesforce Account every thing I needed to work. A very structured 5 Day Training, \" SevOne University\" thats what they named it. Benefits are one of the best in the industry and Compensation wise we are competitively placed. However my overall experience so far \" Awesome\".",
