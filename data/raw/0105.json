And people should understand that this is not a vegetable business to get into the market very next day after the harvest. Since it's a health care product, there are so much of complaince need to be followed and get approved by the government medical council, so it would take ample time.\r\n And those who commented about firing, yes I agree ABK is doing some lay offs at some time.when there is a situation that there is no much  task to give for an employee, then there is no point in retaining him/her. It won't help mutually.\r\nBut we can't deny that,\r\nThey were allowed to attend the interviews out side at anytime\u200b, without\u200b cutting their salary/leave for the day. They were allowed to serve their notice period partially/fully, I don't think many indian companies would do these.\r\n\r\nThere are lot of pros in ABK,\r\n1. Good and balanced work culture.\r\n2. HR is always reachable and listen to the resource.\r\n3. Good pay.\r\n4. Lots of Liberty\u200b towards choosing the Technologies.\r\n5. Scope to learn new technologies.\r\n6. Fresh and innovative ideas are always welcome.\r\n7. Good policies to save tax(for senior employees).\r\n8. Flexible to take leaves.\r\n9.no variable pay.\r\n10. Good and friendly product lead.\r\n11. people in here is amazing, Never faced any cheap politics.",
