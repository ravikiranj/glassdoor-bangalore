In fact middle management gets offended at times, if we give new ideas.\r\n- The management will have all the leisure & facilities including a 35 inch TV with live cricket but has no courtesy to grant employee a good quality food. \r\n- Their identity is miscellaneous , they claim themselves to central govt. some times ,some times private , some time society....to escape granting the benefits to employees, If any body asks for rights .\r\n-  No clear cut policy for higher studies.\r\n- No work from home option neither any govt. leaves benefits.\r\n- Lakhs of rupees are spent on CEO office itself but when it comes to employee benefit, it is always a dumbest excuse given.",
