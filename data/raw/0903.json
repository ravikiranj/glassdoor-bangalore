That is not to say it was all play and no work, work was hard enough to ensure professional development in every sense of the word. I was able to learn a lot of things in a very short span of time, and all credit for this goes to a very able team leader, possibly one of the most intelligent persons on the planet, who inspired us to push ourselves and go over and beyond the call of duty, improving yourselves at every step.
