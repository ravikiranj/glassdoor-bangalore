Apart from Evibe you don't  you  just think if you don't like Andhra food, how you will feel, if you have to eat the same food daily.\r\n\r\nif you will go for 10-15 minutes outside of the office daily, then they will tell that you are spoiling the culture. if you oppose any decision of their co-founder SWATHI BAVANKA, then you might get fired irrespective of whatever good work you have done till now. it happens with 5-6 people till now. Its a kind of Jail. \r\n\r\nThey will talk very sweetly to you at the beginning. They will ask for your original certificate. they will give the agreement. It will be written in the agreement that if you left the job within 1 or 2 year (based on your role ), then you have to give the notice AND you also have to pay two months of your salary. Please see the AND, its not OR. you have to fulfill both otherwise they will not give your original certificate. \r\n\r\nI wondered if any startup has  such a horrible employment contract. Working in a startup is all about interest not forcefully. They know that anybody will leave the company after  seeing their working culture, so that they have such a worst employment contract. In starting you will sign the contract, you will think they are so nice people, why i will leave the company in future, but i bet you would like to leave after sometimes.",

Because no employees to hire a office.\r\nThey have mentioned so many things in the job posting but trust me not even a single thing is true. Not even a single point. \r\nYou will never get paid. Yes you heard me right, you will never get paid. Because \"you need to start giving closures from the day one, otherwise don't ask for salary\". Lol right? But that's what the management says. And afterall you are working for them, so you will have to do what they ask you to. \r\nThey do not have any client database for Bangalore location. I am not Kidding. They will hire you as a recruiter but then put you into BD, because you need requirements to work on right so to get requirements you need clients :P \r\nThey do not have budget to hire a BD so better they utilise you for this work also. Otherwise you will be sitting jobless right? \r\nIf by mistake you ask for salary \"we dont want people who come here for money, we want people who are passionate about their work\" is what you will get to hear. So boss, if you are jobless and want to do some social services, please join this company. \r\nI can go on and on and write a whole lot of points about snapseaarch and how they are playing with our career.
